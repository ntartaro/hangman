#  Hangman
This here is my first coding project for the General Assembly Web Design Immersive class. It's a two-player version of the classic game Hangman. One player enters a word while the other tries to guess it in as few guesses as possible.

## List of Features
There are several features in the game. 
1. Input field: The word or phrase to be guessed goes here
2. Begin button: Starts the game with whatever text is in the input field
3. Letter buttons: The player doing the guessing can press these one by one to try and figure out the hidden word or phrase
4. The gallows: Each wrong letter guess builds a more complete gallows. After 8 wrong guesses, it's game over! Guess correctly and our protagonist walks free
5. Reset button: This button clears all the game conditions and brings you back to fresh game

A future feature would be a random word button that pulls a word from a large database to enable single player games.
